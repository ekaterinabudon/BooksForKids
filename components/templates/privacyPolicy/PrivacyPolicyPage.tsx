This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads on both Books4Kids-owned and operated Services and third-party websites, apps and online services. Interest-based ads, also referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information collected about your online activities, such as when you browse or purchase a product on our Sites or Apps, or visit third-party websites, apps or online services. In providing interest-based ads, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (a coalition of marketing and online advertising organizations). See the “Interest-based advertising opt-out” section of this Privacy Policy, below, for information on how you may opt out of such advertising.</p>

                        <p>Advertisers or third-party ad technology companies working on their behalf sometimes use automated technologies to serve the ads that appear on our Sites and Apps.

                        <p>If you are a California consumer, for more information about your privacy rights, please see the section of this Privacy Policy called “California Privacy Notice”, below.</p>

                        <p>If you are resident of a state that has an effective privacy law, for more information about your privacy rights, please see the section of this Privacy Policy called “State Privacy Notice for Residents Of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Indiana, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and other states that may have applicable privacy law”, below.</p>

                        <p>Cookies: The “Help” feature on most Internet browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you set your browser to limit or remove cookies or otherwise block our use of cookies, some Site features may be unavailable or unable to function properly. Your device may not give you the ability to control cookies.</p>

                        <p>Email marketing opt-out: If you wish to opt out of any of our marketing email communications you may contact our customer service representatives at the email address below, under the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy. You also may follow the “unsubscribe” instructions included in our promotional emails. Please note that removal of user information from our database or “opting out” will not stop marketing or advertising content that is generated for distribution or is otherwise queued for transmission to you prior to the time when we can implement your request. If you unsubscribe from marketing communications, you may continue to receive transactional communications, such as email or text notifications about your order status, recall information and other administrative information. Your information will remain in our database, but will be marked as inactive so you do not receive marketing materials from us.</p>

                        <p>Interest-based advertising opt-out: You may opt out of receiving interest-based ads from us by visiting the DAA consumer opt-out page at https://www.aboutads.info/choices. You also can opt out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) by visiting the NAI consumer opt-out page at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/. Opting out of receiving interest-based ads does not mean that you will no longer receive ads from us, but rather that the ads you receive may not be as relevant to your interests.</p>

                        <p>Do-Not-Track: Some Internet browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Our Sites and Apps do not support “do not track” preferences that may be available in your browser and are not capable of satisfying the preference you set.</p>

                        <p>DATA RETENTION</p>

                        <p>We retain your information for the time period reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or any other notice provided at the time of collection, taking into account applicable statutes of limitation and records retention requirements under applicable law.</p>
